## Project Overview

This project is divided into three key stages:

### 1. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Processed real estate data to handle missing values and detect outliers.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Engineered critical features to capture the dynamics of the housing market, enhancing the overall performance of the predictive model.

### 2. Model Building & Optimization

- **Model Training:**  
  - Trained multiple models including Decision Tree, Lasso, and Linear Regression.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Leveraged GridSearchCV to fine-tune the models, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

### 3. Full-Stack Integration

- **Backend Development:**  
  - Built a Flask API that serves predictions, allowing the model to be accessed programmatically.
  
- **Frontend Development:**  
  - Developed an interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
